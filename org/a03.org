* Document processing & reproducible research

Choose one of these tools, whether it's raw LaTeX or Sweave or knitr
or Pweave or iPython Notebook, and rewrite any three [[file:exercises.html][exercises]] using
your tool of choice.

Please send me your completed assignment by email. You can submit a single file (e.g. a pdf of the final output) for each exercise separately, or you can also construct a single pdf file, that's fine too. *Please make sure that your name is indicated somewhere in each file*.
