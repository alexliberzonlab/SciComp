* Preferred Directions of Spiking Neurons

In this assignment your task is to write code to analyse a real
dataset. You will have to deal with tasks like:

- loading in data from multiple files
- computing various things for each file
- potentially incorporating someone else's code (mine) into your analyses
- combining these computations across all files
- displaying results graphically

** The Data

The data come from an experiment in which extracellular potentials
were recorded from an electrode inserted in layer 5 of primary motor
cortex, during a visually guided arm reaching task ([[http://www.gribblelab.org/publications/2001_Nature_scott.pdf][Scott et al.,
2001]], [[http://www.gribblelab.org/publications/2002_Nature_gribble.pdf][Gribble & Scott, 2002]]).

The task was to move the hand from a central start target to one of 8
peripheral targets spaced around the circumference of a circle
(importantly the spacing was not equal). Each target was presented in
random order, and movements to each of the 8 targets were repeated 5
times.

For each movement to each target, *two quantities* were computed:

1. the mean number of spikes per second over a window starting 150 ms
   before movement onset (as defined by the acceleration of the hand)
   and ending at peak hand velocity, and

2. the movement direction (in radians) of the hand at peak acceleration

Here we will consider data recorded from 100 neurons. For each neuron
we have two files --- one file contains the movement direction data
and a second file contains the neural firing data. For example, for
neuron =001= we have:

cell_dirs_001.txt
#+INCLUDE: "../code/neurondata/cell_dirs_001.txt" src example

cell_spks_001.txt
#+INCLUDE: "../code/neurondata/cell_spks_001.txt" src example

For neuron =001= we have 5 movements (rows) to each of 8 targets
(columns). The file =cell_dirs_001.txt= contains the direction of hand
movement (in radians) for each of the 20 movements, and the file
=cell_spks_001.txt= contains the mean activity (spikes per second)
over a window beginning 150 ms before movement onset and ending at
peak hand velocity.

Here is a graphical depiction of the data for neuron =001=:

Here is some sample MATLAB code to load in cell 001, plot the data,
and compute the preferred directions of each of the 5 trials:
[[file:code/plate_sample_code.m]].

** The Goal

The goal here is to compute the *preferred direction* of each neuron
--- that is, the direction of movement for which the neuron fires most
enthusiastically (most spikes per second) --- and to conduct a
statistical test of whether each neuron is in fact directionally
tuned.

The ultimate goal is to look at the *distribution of preferred
directions* across the population of directionally tuned neurons to
see if all movement directions are equally represented.

** The Analyses

Computing the preferred direction of a neuron is relatively easy, in
cases where the movement directions are spaced equally around the unit
circle. In the so-called /vector method/, all we have to do is sum
together individual vectors whose directions represent the directions
of movements and magnitudes (vector lengths) represent the spiking
rate in those directions. The direction of the resulting vector sum
will represent the preferred direction of the neuron. See
Georgeopoulos et al., 1986 & 1988 for an example:

In our case however we do not have movement directions that are spaced
equally around a unit circle. Taking the simple vector sum will result
in biases. There are a number of possible solutions to this problem
(see [[http://www.gribblelab.org/publications/2002_JNeurosciMeth_gribble.pdf][Gribble & Scott 2002]]).

One solution is to fit the unequally-spaced data to a function (such
as a cosine function, or a von Mises function), and then determine the
movement direction corresponding to the peak of that function. See
Equations 30 and 31 in [[http://www.gribblelab.org/publications/2002_JNeurosciMeth_gribble.pdf][Gribble & Scott 2002]] for cosine and von Mises
functions. Here is an example of fitting a von Mises function to the
first 8-target movement set for neuron 001. We can then simply pick
off the hand direction corresponding to the peak, to get the preferred
direction of the neuron.

[[file:code/vonmisesfit.png]]

The weaknesses of this approach is that fitting functions (e.g. using
optimization techniques) can be time consuming since optimization is
an inherently iterative procedure, and sometimes the fit may not
converge on a global minimum. On ther other hand, computers are fast
now and we have strategies to deal with local minima (e.g. re-running
the optimizations many times from different initial guesses).

** Plate Method

Another solution to the problem of non-uniformly spaced directions was
proposed in [[http://www.gribblelab.org/publications/2002_JNeurosciMeth_gribble.pdf][Gribble & Scott 2002]], that involves a series of direct
calculations (the so-called /plate method/). The advantage of this
method is that there is no iterative optimization, and so it is
faster, and what's more there is no danger of non-convergence.

For this assignment I will provide a function called =platemethod()=
that will compute the preferred direction of a neuron given an array
of directions and an array of spike counts. You are welcome to use it
in your assignment. If you would prefer to use an optimization
approach for your assignment, by all means go ahead and do that. You
have the knowledge and the tools now to do it.

Here is a gzipped tarred directory containing platmethod functions in
MATLAB, in Python, in R and in C:

- [[file:code/platemethodfuns.tgz][platemethodfuns.tgz]]

** Circular statistics

For each neuron we have 5 repetitions of 8-target movements. To
estimate the PD for each neuron we can take the mean PD for each of
the 5 8-target repetitions. Be careful though, taking the mean of
angles is not always straightforward. For example, what is the mean of
2 degrees and 358 degrees? If you simply take the arithmetic mean you
get ((2+358)/2) = 180 degrees. In fact what you want is 0 deg (or
equivalently, 360 deg). The problem is angles "wrap around" 360 deg.

There is a branch of statistics that has been developed to adapt
common measures and methods to angular data, called circular
statistics. For example, see this Wikipedia page for a discussion of
how to compute [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities][the mean of circular quantities]]. There are several
books on circular statistics including:

E. (1981). Circular statistics in biology (Vol. 371). London: Academic
Press.  Chicago
#+END_QUOTE

Another way to estimate the PD of the neuron from all the data is to
just consider the (5 x 8) data set as a single set of data with 40
movements, and run that throught the plate method (or through your
optimizer if you're fitting it to a function). I will leave it up to
you to decide how to estimate the mean PD.

** Statistical test of Tuning

You can imagine that for a neuron that is *not* directionally tuned,
if you nevertheless compute a preferred direction for it, and you do
this multiple times, with a different set of movements each time, what
will happen is that each time you compute a preferred direction, it
will be different than the last one ... and over many repetitions, you
will get preferred directions all over the place (they will not be
very consistent). On the other hand if a neuron is highly tuned, then
each time you compute a preferred direction, the result will be
consistent from movement set to movement set.

To quantitatively test whether a neuron is tuned, we can do the
following, as long as we have multiple 8-target movement sets for the
neuron (we do in this case, we have 5 repetitions for each target
direction).

1. for each of the 5 8-target movement sets $i$, compute the preferred
   direction $pd_{i}$ of the neuron
2. construct a vector $v_{i}$ whose length is $1$ and whose direction
   is the preferred direction computed from each 8-movement set
   $pd_{i}$
3. add the 5 vectors $v_{i}$ together (vector addition) and compute
   the length $r$ of the resulting vector.

The logic is, the more consistent the $pd$ is over repetitions of the
8-movement target set, the larger $r$ will be.

Now that we have a measure of directional tuning ($r$), we can do a
statistical test to determine whether $r$ is "significant" or not. The
way we will do this is by using a bootstrapping or resampling
technique. Here is what we will do.

We will repeat the following procedure a large number of times (e.g. 10,000):

1. Create a new set of (5 x 8) spike data, by randomly sampling, with
   replacement, from the original set.
2. Compute $r$, the measure of tuning
3. Save $r$ to a list (of 10,000 $r$ values over the 10,000
   repetitions of this procedure)
4. Once we have our 10,000 $r$ values, determine *what proportion* of
   the 10,000 simulated $r$ values are as large or larger than the
   empirically observed r value, which we computed above.

The logic here is that in our 10,000 simulations, we are *simulating
the null hypothesis* where the null hypothesis is that the neuron is
not directionally tuned, and the spike count for a given direction is
random (in this case, randomly sampled from the "population" of (5
x 8) spike counts collected for each neuron). If the actual $r$ value
we compute based on the actual data is less than 5% likely in our
simulation of the null hypothesis, we reject the null hypothesis that
the neuron is not directionally tuned, and we conclude that it is in
fact directionally tuned.

For example, if we take neuron 005, I have computed using the plate
method that the measure $r$ of direction tuning is $r=3.9804$. When I
perform a bootstrap test using 10,000 iterations, I get the following
distribution of $r$ values under the null hypothesis (i.e. when I
randomly sample with replacement from the original (5 x 8) set of
spike data:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400
[[file:code/neuronboot.png]]

The observed tuning parameter $r$ is plotted as a vertical red line
overtop of the distribution of $r$ under the null hypothesis, as
assessed by the bootstrap test using 10,000 random resamplings (with
replacement) of the spike data. As you can see only a small proportion
of the bootstrap values of $r$ are greater than our observed value of
$r=3.9804$. In fact if we count, there are 331 out of 10,000 that are
greater than or equal to $r=3.9804$. This corresponds to $p =
0.0331$. If we use an alpha value of $p = 0.05$ as our cutoff for
rejecting the null hypothesis, we would indeed reject the null in this
case (the null being that the neuron is not directionally tuned) and
we would conclude that the neuron is in fact directionally
tuned. Actually if we want to be technically correct from a
statistical point of view, we would say that the chances are very low
that the cell is not directionally tuned... i.e. assuming the null
hypothesis is true, the chance of observing a tuning parameter $r$ as
extreme or more extreme than the one we actually observed is only 3.31
%. If we wanted to be more conservative we could set our alpha level
at $p = 0.01$.

When testing your code, perhaps set the number of bootstrap iterations
to 1,000 or even 100 for testing pruposes. When you are confident your
code is working, set it to 10,000 and go get a coffee.

** Tasks

So your tasks are:

1. Compute an estimate of the preferred direction of each neuron.
2. Count how many neurons out of 100 are directionally tuned (using
   whatever alpha level cutoff you wish)
3. For those neurons that are directionally tuned, graphically display
   the distribution of preferred directions over the population of
   neurons.

** Some Guidance

When I run my code with 10,000 bootstraps on the 100 neurons, here is
what I get in terms of neurons that are significantly tuned:

- p < .050 : 92 neurons
- p < .010 : 78 neurons
- p < .005 : 73 neurons

You may not get the exact same numbers as me, since your random
selection in your bootstrap will be different ... but you ought to get
something relatively close.

For p < .05, the neurons that are not significantly tuned, at least in
my code, are neurons:

41, 42, 43, 55, 56, 66, 76, 85

If anyone is really struggling, just come and see me, I can help. I'd
rather everyone see the assignment through to the end, even if you
need some help, than for some to not finish.

As a benchmark, here are the PDs (in radians) of the 5 repetitions for
the data from neuron 001, using the supplied platemethod function in
MATLAB:

4.0845    4.3150    4.3715    4.3153    4.2462

You should get something pretty much identical in your Python or R
version of the platemethod function.

** Speed Contest

Finally, *time your code*: how long does it take to compute the
estimate of the preferred direction, and the bootstrap probability,
for all 100 neurons, using 10,000 bootstrap iterations? We will have a
contest to see whose code runs the fastest (we will run it on my
laptop). The winner gets a prize.

Some timing targets for you, run on my current laptop (Apple MacBook
Pro Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 with 4 CPU
cores). Time indicates total time to compute estimate of preferred
direction and to compute a bootstrap probability using 10,000
iterations, for all 100 neurons. Note we haven't yet talked about how
to parallelize code and take advantage of multiple cores on your CPU,
but I've included the times here just to show you how much of an
improvement you can get.

** Your code

When writing your code, assume the data are located in a subdirectory
relative to the location of your code, called =neurondata/=. You can
download the data directory here:

[[file:code/neurondata.tgz][neurondata.tgz]]

I should be able to put your code in a directory containing
=neurondata/= and run your code without adjusting anything.

Please send me your completed assignment by email. Send (1) your code
and (2) a short report summarizing the findings from your
analyses. *Please make sure that your name is indicated somewhere in
each file*.
