* Numerical Differentiation

The following equation can be used to find an approximate derivative
of a mathematical function $f(x)$ if $h$ is sufficiently small:

\begin{equation}
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}
\end{equation}

Write a function =diff(f, x, h)= that returns the approximation of the
derivative of a mathematical function represented by a function
=f(x)=.

Apply this to differentiate:

- $f(x) = \left( e^{x} \right)$ at $x=0$
- $f(x) = \left( e^{-2x^{2}} \right)$ at $x=0$
- $f(x) = \left( \cos x \right)$ at $x = 2\pi$
- $f(x) = \left( \ln x \right)$ at $x=1$

Use $h = 0.01$

In each case write out the error, i.e., the difference between the
exact derivative and the result of the approximation.

If you need help finding out what the exact solutions to these
derivatives are, (1) try to remember your calculus!, (2) ask a
classmate, (3) google it, or (4) ask me.
