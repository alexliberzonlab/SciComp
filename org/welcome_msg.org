* Goals of the course

The goal of this one-semester graduate seminar is to provide you with
skills in scientific computing --- tools and techniques that you can use
in your own research. We will focus on learning to think about
experiments and data in a computational framework, and we will learn
to implement specific data processing and analysis algorithms using a
high-level programming language.

The course is designed to achieve four primary goals:

1. to teach you to program in a high-level language such as
   Python, Matlab, R, and C.
2. to introduce you to Unix (either via the Mac, or GNU/Linux), and to
   some common computing tools that will help you become more
   efficient with using your computer for research.
3. to introduce you to some common computational techniques
   (not necessarily "statistics" per se) for data processing and
   analysis --- e.g. curve-fitting, simulation, optimization & gradient
   descent, frequency-domain analysis and filtering, parallel
   programming, interacting with hardware, organization and storage of
   data, programming GUIs (graphical user interfaces), and others.
4. to get you to think computationally and algorithmically
   about data processing, analysis, modeling and visualization.

Even if you don't become a full-fledged programmer yourself, you will
have learned enough to know what is possible given today's
computational resources. This will enable you in the future to design
cutting edge experiments and data analysis approaches that take full
advantage of the computational resources available to you --- whether
programmed yourself, or by programmers and technicians that you hire.

* Exercises, Assignments and Grades

Each week we will go over a series of programming exercises that are
designed to get you going with the concepts we cover each week. The
exercises are not graded. The idea is for you try have a go, and when
you have problems, questions, etc, ask each other, and ask me for
help. The best way to learn programming is to program.

Each week I will set an assignment that will be graded. The course
grade will be based on the weekly assignments (90% weighting) and a
"course participation" mark (10% weighting).

The assignments will have several components. Some components will be
easy, some will be more difficult, and some assignments may contain
components that are rather challenging. Do your best, and don't be
afraid to go to each other for help. I'm all in favour of students
working together on assignments. I just don't want to find out that
you are handing in work that is not your own. I'm perfectly willing to
give you hints, so don't hesitate to come to me for help (although do
make sure that you've given it a good try yourself, first... read this
blog post, [[http://mattgemmell.com/2008/12/08/what-have-you-tried/][What have you tried?]] by Matt Gemmell --- it's aimed at
professional programmers but I think it applies equally well to us
all, in whatever field we work in).

* Which programming language(s)?

The issue of which language to use in the course is an interesting
one. In the past I have taught the course using only one language to
demonstrate concepts. Once we used Matlab. Another time we used
Python. The problem I see with using only one language is that we risk
turning the course into a "how to use language X" course rather than a
course in learning computing concepts, and using a given language to
demonstrate the concepts. On the other hand, there is no doubt that a
major component of learning to be a competent programmer is learning
the ins and outs and specific features of a given language.

We will talk about this during the first class and we will decide how
to proceed this year. My present inclination is to use Python, Matlab,
R and perhaps even C to demonstrate concepts in the course, and to
allow students to submit assignments in any of these languages. As I
said though we will talk about this during our first meeting and
decide what is best for our class this year.

* Which operating system(s)?

We will be using Unix in the course. The Macintosh OS is unix-based,
so if you have a mac (and a reasonably recent version of the OS), you
can use that. If not then I suggest you use GNU/Linux. I won't say you
can't use Microsoft Windows, but please know that I have no expertise
with Windows, and I will not be able to help you except to say "stop
using Windows". We will have a discussion and a tutorial session at
the beginning of the course about how best to set up your computer to
use GNU/Linux. You will have several choices.

* Why learn to code?

Learning how to program will significantly enhance your ability to
conduct scientific research today and in the future. Programming
skills will provide you with the ability to go beyond what is
available in pre-packaged analysis tools, and code your own custom
data processing, analysis and visualization pipelines.

Learning to code is probably one of the most useful general skills you
can learn as a scientist today. You will learn how to think
computationally and algorithmically about your experiments and your
data. You will learn to take full advantage of the enormous
computational resources available to you --- today's laptops are more
powerful than the multi-million dollar supercomputers of the 1980s and
90s.

* Next steps

Stay tuned... we are going to have fun and learn a lot!

If you already know how to set yourself up to use GNU/Linux, then go
ahead and complete the setup. I suggest Ubuntu or Debian or another
Debian variant like Linux Mint. If you know what you're doing, feel
free to use some other distribution.

One option is to use [[https://www.virtualbox.org][VirtualBox]] to create a virtual appliance running
GNU/Linux that lives either onto your laptop's hard disk or onto an
external drive of your choosing. Then you can run linux in a virtual
machine without disturbing your existing operating system.

The course notes will be posted and updated online as we go.
