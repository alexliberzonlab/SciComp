* Scoring Kinematics

The file [[file:code/e31data.txt][e31data.txt]] contains Optotrak measurements of a single-joint elbow rotation over time. The angle between the upper and lower arm (in radians) was sampled at 200 Hz. Here is a plot of the data file:

Answer the following questions about the data. Use whatever signal processing techniques you wish, to answer each question. Explain the signal processing steps you took, and why.

** Position

Determine the angle (in degrees) that the elbow rotated over the course of the arm movement.

** Velocity

Determine the peak velocity, in radians per second, of the elbow movement. Hint: use the =gradient()= function to compute the central difference so you don't introduce a time lag and so the derivative has the same number of elements as the position array.

** Acceleration

Determine the peak positive and peak negative accelerations, in radians per second per second.
