* Subplots

Let x be a vector starting at 1 and ending at 100. Let y be a vector
equal to (x * 0.15) + N where N is a vector of random values chosen
from a gaussian distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0.

Let z be equal to ((x * 0.05) + 2) + N where N is a vector of random
values chosen from a gaussian distribution with mean 0.0 and standard
deviation 1.5.

Generate a figure with scatterplots of (x vs y) and (x vs z) in
separate subplots, stacked vertically:

* horizontally

Generate the plot again but stack the subplots horizontally:

#+ATTR_HTML: height="300" border="1"

* more complex arrangements

Generate the plot again with 3 subplots: one on the top, occupying the full width of the figure, in which you plot (x vs y) and (x vs z) overlayed, and two on the bottom, in which you plot (x vs y) in one and (x vs z) in the other:
