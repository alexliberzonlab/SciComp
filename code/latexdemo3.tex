\maketitle

We will see two equations here. Equation \ref{eq:regression_line}
gives the formula for a line of best fit for a linear
regression. Equation \ref{eq:sample_mean} gives the formula for the
mean of a sample. It is not the same as Equation
\ref{eq:regression_line}.

This is an equation: $\hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X$.

\begin{equation}
  \hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X
\label{eq:regression_line}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}
\label{eq:sample_mean}
\end{equation}

Note how the equation numbering is handled automatically for you.
