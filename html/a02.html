<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Sorting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Learning to program involves several things:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>learning the syntax of a specific programming language (boring)
</li>
<li>learning the names of functions that do specific common tasks
(boring)
</li>
<li>learning about a common set of programming paradigms &#x2014; variable
assignment, loops, if-else statements, logical operators, etc (sort
of interesting)
</li>
<li>learning about what functionality is built-in to the language, what
things you can add with third-party libraries, and what you will
have to program on your own (slightly less boring)
</li>
<li>learning about algorithms, i.e. ways of solving problems (exciting!)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of the classic problems that has been used for decades in computer
science curricula for teaching principles of algorithmic design and
analysis, is the <b>sorting problem</b>.
</p>

<p>
Said plainly, you are given a list of \(n\) items and a function \(f\) for
comparing pairs of items. Your task is to <b>sort</b> the list of items,
typically in increasing order.
</p>

<p>
So for example you might have a list <code>L</code> of \(n=10\) integers:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a0522d;">L</span> = [2,6,5,4,3,7,8,10,24,3]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We have a function (actually an operator, the <code>&lt;</code> operator) for testing whether one item is greater or less than another item:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">L[3] &lt; L[5]
<span style="color: #008b8b;">True</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and so the task in the sorting problem is to produce a new list <code>LS</code> in which the items of <code>L</code> are sorted in increasing order. The solution to the example problem would be:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">LS
[2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 24]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Languages like Python, MATLAB, Octave and R have built-in functions
for sorting lists. For example in Python we could have typed
<code>L.sort()</code> and our list <code>L</code> from above would have been sorted. In R
the function to sort is called <code>order()</code> and in MATLAB it's <code>sort()</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The question is, though, how exactly do you sort a list of items? What
is the <b>algorithm</b>? In fact many different algorithms have been
proposed for how to sort a list of items. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">wikipedia page on
sorting algorithms</a> provides a really nice introduction to the range of
algorithms that have been well described and well studied.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">why sorting?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Why is sorting worth even talking about? It seems like such a tedious problem to spend time solving. There are a couple of reasons.
</p>

<p>
The scientific reason is that it turns out that sorting is actually a
very difficult problem to solve <i>efficiently</i>. Inefficient sorting
algorithms are pretty easy to generate. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a> is a good
example. It's easy to understand how it works, it's easy to program,
and it works well for small lists. However it turns out to be a very
inefficient algorithm as the list size increases (bubble sort is an
\(O(n^{2})\) algorithm). So there is a kind of "arms race" for sorting
algorithms, i.e. a sort of competition to generate the most efficient
algorithm. Algorithms differ in terms of their memory load, their
speed, and their efficiency as list size increases. The wikipedia page
has a table showing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_of_algorithms">comparison of algorithms</a> in terms of best,
averge and worst complexity, memory load, and stability. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge sort</a> algorithms are generally regarded as the best to date
in terms of efficiency and implementation.
</p>

<p>
The practical rationales for studying sorting algorithms are (1) lots
of everyday problems involving computer programs end up using sorting
(e.g. databases like in banks, or Revenue Canada, or Google, Faceboob,
etc). Performing sorts efficiently can have a big impact on the
usability of these kinds of products.
</p>

<p>
The other practical reason which applies to us in this course, is that
studying and implementing sorting algorithms represents a really good
exercise in how to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>characterize a problem to be solved by a computer program
</li>
<li>think about a solution
</li>
<li>formulate an algorithm
</li>
<li>generate code to implement the algorithm
</li>
<li>debug your code
</li>
<li>test the idea for correctness on a set of examples
</li>
<li>analyse the algorithm for efficiency
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Your assignment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The various sorting algorithms listed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">wikipedia page on sorting</a>
vary greatly in terms of their complexity and their efficiency. If I
pick one and ask everyone to implement it, then for some of you it
will be way to easy, for some of you it will be way to hard, and that
won't be of much use.
</p>

<p>
Instead what I'm going to do is take a page from <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8011180/2120/asn4.html">Mark Daley's course</a>
and ask you to <b>choose</b> a sorting algorithm from the following list,
and implement it in the language of your choice:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>selection sort
</li>
<li>insertion sort
</li>
<li>bubble sort
</li>
<li>bogosort
</li>
<li>quick sort
</li>
<li>merge sort
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we've talked about before, one of the ways in which you will use
programming in your scientific future, is to first read about an
algorithm or a set of data analysis steps in a paper, and then go and
try to implement it yourself. This assignment will help you develop
those skills, in the context of a problem (sorting) that is relatively
familiar to you, even if the algorithms aren't.
</p>

<p>
You can find descriptions of the sorting algorithms on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">wikipedia
page on sorting</a>, and in any modern computer science textbook on
algorithms. You can also search google and find lots of descriptions
of each.
</p>

<p>
You will see that for some of these algorithms, there have been many
optimizations developed that extend the "basic" form of the algorithm
into something more complex. It's up to you how far down the rabbit
hole to go. Your task here is to choose an algorithm that suits your
programming abilities today, and to implement it from scratch. There
is no particular requirement to implement the fully optimized versions
of these algorithms. The basic forms are ok for the purposes of this
assignment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">don't be lazy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Of course you can also find lots of examples of source code for
implementing each of these sorting algorithms, online. I'm asking you
not to simply cut and paste code that you find online and submit that
as your assignment. That would be lazy and it wouldn't really be that
useful to you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">give it a go</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Spend some time reading about the algorithms. Spend some time thinking
about how you would implement them, given the programming skillset
that you have so far. Spend some time writing and testing code.
</p>

<p>
When you run into problems, talk to classmates. Come and talk to
me. I'm perfectly happy to give you pointers and to help clarify concepts.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">do the following</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
So your assignment then is to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>implement one of the sorting algorithms listed above, in the
language of your choice. You can assume that your algorithm will
operate on lists of integers.
</li>
<li>demonstrate that your algorithm works by testing it on some example lists
</li>
<li>test the efficiency of your code by analysing (either by timing it,
or by counting operations) how it scales as the size of the list
increases.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Document your code with comments. Submit both (1) your code, which I
ought to be able to run without any modifications, and (2) a short
document that describes how you tested your code for correctness and
efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Please send me your completed assignment by email. <b>Please make sure
that your name is indicated somewhere in the file</b>.
