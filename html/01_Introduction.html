Our main plan for the first class will be to talk about the course
content, and to get everyone set up on their laptop with an appropriate programming environment.
</p>
<p>
In our second class we will start in on the first batch of programming
exercises which will illustrate getting values from the user, printing
strings, doing arithmetic, and we will be introduced to loops.

<h2 id="sec-1">Organization of the course</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Last year we tried a new approach to how classes are run, that worked
well. Instead of me lecturing for an hour, and then you going away and
attemping programming exercises and assignments, we "inverted the
classroom". Classroom time was spent working on exercises and
assignments, and asking questions, and students completed readings and
went over lecture notes outside of class.
</p>
<p>
The benefit of this approach from my point of view is that we spend
time in class in a more interactive way, and (especially earling in
learning programming techniques) students get more out of classroom
time than if you were just listening to me blab on and on.
</p>
<p>
What this does require however is that you come prepared to each
class, having done the readings and whatever other preparation is
specified on the schedule.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Setting up your computing environment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
I will be using unix-style tools, sometimes on my Mac and sometimes on
a linux machine (or in a linux virtual machine). If you have a Mac and
are running a relatively recent version of Mac OSX then you can
probably achieve the same functionality by installing unix-based tools
on your Mac. We will talk about this in class. If you have a Windows
laptop then your choices may be more limited.
</p>
<p>
For using linux, you have essentially four choices about how you can
set things up, assuming you are not already set up to use linux. In
order of most committed to least committed:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Wipe your existing operating system and install linux. There are
   several flavours (see the <a href="http://www.gribblelab.org/scicomp/resources.html#sec-11">resources</a> page)
</li>
<li>Repartition your hard drive and set up a dual-boot system. You can
   find instructions on the web, e.g. for <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot">Windows Dual Boot</a>
   and <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/MacOSX">Dual Boot Mac OSX</a>. Instructions for other linux flavours can be
   found easily on the web.
</li>
<li>Boot your laptop from an external drive that has a linux boot
   partition set up. Again, find instructions on the web for your
   favourite linux flavour.
</li>
<li>Run a linux virtual appliance in a virtualization application such
   as <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>. I will provide such an appliance that runs <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>
   and has all of the software we will need, preinstalled. I will also
   provide an appliance that runs <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a> in case you'd like to try
   that instead. Ubuntu has arguably done a better job of making linux
   look nice visually. Note that both images will be imported as 20GB
   virtual machines so you need at least that much space to run
   them. If you need to, I suggest putting them on an external drive.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
If you decide you don't want to use linux, but you do want to use
Python + SciPy and all of the other python-based scientific packages,
then I suggest installing the <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a> distribution from Continuum
Analytics. It's free and it provides an easy all-in-one Python + SciPy
system.
</p>
<p>
If you have decided that you're using MATLAB, then it should not be a
big deal to get it installed on your machine, whether you're running
Mac, Windows or even linux.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Programming Languages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
There are many programming languages that are used today for
scientific computing, and it's likely that you will be exposed to code
in many languages over the course of your career as a graduate student
in the sciences.
</p>
<p>
Unless you decide that you would rather code everything you ever need
on your own, from scratch, in one language, it's likely that you will
be using programs, code snippets and libraries written by others, to
accomplish the tasks you need to complete to do your research and data
analysis. Life will be better for you if you're somewhat proficient,
or at least familiar, with several programming languages.
</p>
<p>
In this course we will learn some basic programming paradigms and
patterns that are not language specific. We will sometimes be looking
at example code in different languages. This has the risk of being
confusing, as different languages have different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a>, and the
differences are sometimes subtle. The benefit however is that you will
see that with few exceptions, most languages are essentially the same,
at least in broad strokes, and differ only in their syntax, and in the
names for various functions. There are some low-level differences
between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">compiled</a> languages that we will talk about
later, that make a big difference in terms of the speed that your code
runs.
</p>
<p>
The languages we will be seeing in this course are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a>: commerical, engineering-oriented numerical programming environment
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a>: free, open-source clone of Matlab
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>: free, open-source high level programming language
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scipy.org">SciPy</a>: a Python-based ecosystem for math, science &amp; engineering,
  that includes:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.numpy.org">NumPy</a>: library for numerical computing with Python
</li>
<li><a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>: 2D plotting library for Python
</li>
<li><a href="http://ipython.org">iPython</a>: improved interface for interactive computing with Python
</li>
<li><a href="http://sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a>: Python library for symbolic mathematics
</li>
<li><a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>: data structures and data analysis tools for Python
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>: free, open-source language for statistical computing &amp; graphics
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>: a high level, general purpose compiled language
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Other languages you may encounter in your travels as a graduate student and as a scientist are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++">C++</a>: basically an object-oriented (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>) version of C
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective C</a>: another OOP version of C, used primarly by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html">Apple</a> to
  write Mac OSX and iOS applications
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>: a general purpose OOP language
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>: like Java for running inside web browsers
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>: another general purpose OOP language
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>: a general purpose compiled language aimed at numerical and
  scientific computing
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>: a commercial environment for mathematical computation
  and visualization (popular with pure math types, not so much
  engineers)
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a>: a free, open-source math system sort of aimed at being a
  Mathematica replacement
</li>
</ul>


<p>
There are also some new languages that are gaining traction:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://julialang.org">julia</a>: a high-level dynamic language aimed at numerical and
  technical computing. The love child of Python and C
</li>
<li><a href="http://golang.org">go</a>: high-level OOP compiled language designed at Google, sort of a
  Googly version of C
</li>
</ul>


<p>
There are many other languages out there that are still in use but
these are the ones you are likely to encounter in the scientific and
numerical computing sphere.
</p>
<p>
For our purposes, we will be primarily seeing code
in <b>Python</b>, <b>Matlab/Octave</b> and <b>R</b>. Occasionally I will show you
a <b>C</b> version of a program as an illustration of how much faster a
compiled language can be compared to an interpreted language (Python,
Matlab/Octave and R are all interpreted languages).
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Am I supposed to learn \(n\) different languages in this course? (where \(n&gt;1\))</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">


<p>
No. For exercises and assignments you can use whatever language you
like. I will be providing examples in Python, Matlab/Octave, R and
occasionally C. My expectation is not that you learn 4 programming
languages in this course. My expectation is that you learn to program
in one language of your choosing, and that you at least gain exposure
to what code looks like in other languages.
</p>
<p>
In doing so I hope that you'll learn at least two important lessons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>you will see that mostly, all high level languages are basically
   the same, but with different syntax and different names for things
</li>
<li>you will become familiar with the range of languages and associated
   libraries, toolboxes and add-on modules that are available to you
   as a scientist
</li>
</ol>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">So what language should I use?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">


<p>
The answer to this question is to use the language that will be most
beneficial for you personally going forward. This could depend on
things like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>what language(s) are in common use in your supervisor's lab right now?
</li>
<li>are there existing toolboxes or libraries for a certain language
  that you know in advance will be particularly useful to you in your
  research?
</li>
<li>Do you want to spend money? (MATLAB costs money and is a
  proprietary, closed source product; Python, R, Octave and C are free
  and open source)
</li>
<li>what language(s) do you already know, and are you interested in
  refining what you already know, and/or becoming proficient in
  another language?
</li>
</ul>


<p>
If you know you don't need MATLAB (because for example your lab
already uses MATLAB) then I suggest using Python for the course. Its
libraries are broader than R, which is mainly a language oriented
around doing statistics. An easy way to install Python plus all of the
SciPy toolboxes is using <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>, which should work on Windows and
Mac.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in another language, come and see me and we can
make sure it's going to be a suitable plan.
</p>
<p>
If you already have experience with the interpreted languages we will
be looking at in this course and you would like to challenge yourself
and learn some C, then this <a href="http://www.gribblelab.org/CBootcamp/index.html">C Programming Boot Camp</a> might be useful to
you. There are also tons of resources online, and books, about
programming in C.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">Editors and IDEs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">


<p>
Many programming language come with a so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">Integrated Development</a>
Environments or IDE. MATLAB comes with one of these. There is one for
R called <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a>, and there is one for Python/SciPy called <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Canopy</a>. For
C there are many. On the Mac, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> is the standard for developing Mac
OSX and iOS programs. On Windows there are products like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)">Eclipse</a> that
provide an IDE for several languages.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea of an IDE is that you get a pretty, graphical
multi-windowed environment where you can see your code alongside
various tools such as debuggers, variable lists and memory profiles,
file systems and directories, and click-and-point menus for access to
a variety of functions and toolboxes.
</p>
<p>
In this course I will not be using an IDE, and I would encourage you
not to use one either. This is not because I think they are
necessarily a bad idea, but because I think the various conveniences
they provide promote a certain intellectual laziness especially for
beginning programmers. For an experienced programmer an IDE can
certainly increase efficiency. For a beginning programmer however I
think it's more important to (at least initially) do all of that stuff
in your head (or with a piece of paper and a pencil). A reading is
relevant here: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html">Holding a Program in One's Head</a>.
</p>
<p>
What I will be doing, and what I suggest you do in the course, is use
a basic <b>two window setup</b>: one window for the code interpreter (or
compiler) and a second window for your editor (where you edit your
code).

During our first meeting we will be talking about the pros and cons of
the various ways of getting linux onto your laptop.
</p>
<p>
A brief note about laptops: I am assuming in this course that you own
(or you have access to) a laptop computer. If you don't, then it's
time to buy one. I don't feel particularly uncomfortable asking
students to buy a laptop, since prices are low enough nowadays that
you can find a modern, suitable laptop for a few hundred dollars ---
essentially the cost of buying several high-end textbooks. If this is
a serious issue for you, let me know and we can talk about what your
options are.
</p>
<p>
So your first task in the course is to get your linux setup up and
running.
</p>
<p>
Your second task is to write and run a "Hello, World" program in the
language of your choice. Here is some code for you in a variety of
languages:
</p>



<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Python</span>
<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Hello, World"</span>
</pre>



<pre class="src src-octave"><span style="color: #b22222;">% </span><span style="color: #b22222;">MATLAB / Octave</span>
disp(<span style="color: #8b2252;">'Hello, World'</span>);
</pre>



<pre class="src src-r"># R
cat(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Hello, World\n"</span>)
</pre>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">C</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">to compile: gcc -o hello hello.c</span>
<span style="color: #483d8b;">#include</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">main</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">argc</span>, <span style="color: #228b22;">char</span> *<span style="color: #a0522d;">argv</span>[]) {

  printf(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Hello, World\n"</span>);

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> 0;
}
